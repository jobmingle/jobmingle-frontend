				<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-stone-700 p-[1rem]">Vendors</h2>
				<p>
					<span className="font-bold">Vendor Registration: </span>
					To list courses on JobMingle, vendors must complete a straightforward
					registration process. At present, we extend a special offer, allowing
					vendors to showcase their courses on our platform without incurring
					any fees.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span className="font-bold">Vendor Content: </span>
					Vendors retain complete ownership of their course content while
					ensuring exclusivity for purchasers. This means that only individuals
					who have made a purchase gain access to the valuable materials and
					insights offered by our dedicated vendors. This safeguards the
					integrity and uniqueness of each course.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span className="font-bold">Vendor Payment: </span>
					Our platform operates on a mutually beneficial model where the fee
					JobMingle deducts from a course sale is determined through a
					transparent agreement between JobMingle and the vendor. This fosters
					trust and collaboration, aligning the interests of both parties in
					delivering high-quality, impactful courses to our users. Vendors can
					also anticipate regular payments every two weeks, reinforcing our
					commitment to their success.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span className="font-bold">Course Pricing: </span>
					At JobMingle, we believe in making online education accessible to
					everyone. To achieve this, we heavily subsidize the cost of courses
					listed on our platform. Consequently, courses on JobMingle are priced
					differently from those on external platforms, ensuring affordability
					and inclusivity for a diverse audience seeking to educate themselves
					with high-income skills to have access to remote opportunities.
