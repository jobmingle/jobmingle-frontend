This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

<!-- Task: Build landing page

Notes: 
1. Use the attached image as a template for the hero section.
2. The navbar should remain the same.
3. The navbar links should be about, contact, jobs, and the cta(signup). The logo should serve as the home link
4. It should be a one page site. All the links should scroll to the required section on the page (except the job)
5. You're expected to embed the about page into the homepage. (The point of being a one page site)
6. Stick to the jobmingle brand colours and you can use high quality images of your choice that express the design properly (from unsplashed and co)
7. Use your intuition to improve the designs but stick to the primary colours and the branding (i.e no illustrations) -->
